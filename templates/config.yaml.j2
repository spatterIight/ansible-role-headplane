# Configuration for the Headplane server and web application
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: {{ headplane_container_http_port }}

  # The secret used to encode and decode web sessions
  # Ensure that this is exactly 32 characters long
  cookie_secret: "{{ headplane_cookie_secret }}"

  # Should the cookies only work over HTTPS?
  # Set to false if running via HTTP without a proxy
  # (I recommend this is true in production)
  cookie_secure: true

  # The path to persist Headplane specific data. All data going forward
  # is stored in this directory, including the internal database and
  # any cache related files.
  #
  # Data formats prior to 0.6.1 will automatically be migrated.
  # PLEASE ensure this directory is mounted if running in Docker.
  data_path: "/var/lib/headplane"

# Headscale specific settings to allow Headplane to talk
# to Headscale and access deep integration features
headscale:
  # The URL to your Headscale instance
  # (All API requests are routed through this URL)
  # (THIS IS NOT the gRPC endpoint, but the HTTP endpoint)
  #
  # IMPORTANT: If you are using TLS this MUST be set to `https://`
  url: "http://{{ headplane_headscale_hostname }}:{{ headplane_headscale_port }}"

  # If you use the TLS configuration in Headscale, and you are not using
  # Let's Encrypt for your certificate, pass in the path to the certificate.
  # (This has no effect `url` does not start with `https://`)
  # tls_cert_path: "/var/lib/headplane/tls.crt"

  # Optional, public URL if they differ
  # This affects certain parts of the web UI
  # public_url: "https://headscale.example.com"

  # Path to the Headscale configuration file
  # This is optional, but HIGHLY recommended for the best experience
  # If this is read only, Headplane will show your configuration settings
  # in the Web UI, but they cannot be changed.
  config_path: "/etc/headscale/config.yaml"

  # Headplane internally validates the Headscale configuration
  # to ensure that it changes the configuration in a safe way.
  # If you want to disable this validation, set this to false.
  config_strict: true

  # If you are using `dns.extra_records_path` in your Headscale
  # configuration, you need to set this to the path for Headplane
  # to be able to read the DNS records.
  #
  # Pass it in if using Docker and ensure that the file is both
  # readable and writable to the Headplane process.
  # When using this, Headplane will no longer need to automatically
  # restart Headscale for DNS record changes.
  # dns_records_path: "/var/lib/headplane/extra_records.json"

# Integration configurations for Headplane to interact with Headscale
integration:
  agent:
    # The Headplane agent allows retrieving information about nodes
    # This allows the UI to display version, OS, and connectivity data
    # You will see the Headplane agent in your Tailnet as a node when
    # it connects.
    enabled: false
    # To connect to your Tailnet, you need to generate a pre-auth key
    # This can be done via the web UI or through the `headscale` CLI.
    pre_authkey: "<your-preauth-key>"
    # Optionally change the name of the agent in the Tailnet.
    # host_name: "headplane-agent"

    # Configure different caching settings. By default, the agent will store
    # caches in the path below for a maximum of 1 minute. If you want data
    # to update faster, reduce the TTL, but this will increase the frequency
    # of requests to Headscale.
    # cache_ttl: 60
    # cache_path: /var/lib/headplane/agent_cache.json

    # Do not change this unless you are running a custom deployment.
    # The work_dir represents where the agent will store its data to be able
    # to automatically reauthenticate with your Tailnet. It needs to be
    # writable by the user running the Headplane process.
    # work_dir: "/var/lib/headplane/agent"

  # Only one of these should be enabled at a time or you will get errors
  # This does not include the agent integration (above), which can be enabled
  # at the same time as any of these and is recommended for the best experience.
  docker:
    enabled: false

    # By default we check for the presence of a container label (see the docs)
    # to determine the container to signal when changes are made to DNS settings.
    container_label: "me.tale.headplane.target=headscale"

    # HOWEVER, you can fallback to a container name if you desire, but this is
    # not recommended as its brittle and doesn't work with orchestrators that
    # automatically assign container names.
    #
    # If `container_name` is set, it will override any label checks.
    # container_name: "headscale"

    # The path to the Docker socket (do not change this if you are unsure)
    # Docker socket paths must start with unix:// or tcp:// and at the moment
    # https connections are not supported.
    socket: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
